# Podcast Soundboard Keyboard

Using an ATMEGA32u4 controller, I'm setting this up as a keyboard to interface with a computer, and eventually use this as an immediate input device to output sound from the computer into the mixer board. I intend to move this into python eventually (since it's more universal), but right now I'm using AHK for the keyboard interpereter.
